## Why?
At present we use many Electron Apps to have access to nativ API's on Windows and Linux and MacOs i want to build a abstraction layer for that nativ caps and expose that in a android like request api so that you can run a single instance on the host system and all other applications can request permissions on that implamentation.

It should also enable companys to Code Applications and give them restricted access to Physical Resources which is a hugh security win it is similar to the way Containers do Work
